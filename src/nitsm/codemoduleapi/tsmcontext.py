        Returns all sessions in the Semiconductor Module context associated with pins.

        Args:
            instrument_type_id: The type of instrument for which you want to get sessions. All
                instruments defined in the pin map specify an associated type ID. The
                nitsm.codemoduleapi.InstrumentTypeIdConstants class contains instrument type IDs for
                instrument types that TSM supports natively. For all other types of instruments, you
                must define a type ID for the instrument in the pin map file. Typically, this type
                ID is an instrument driver name or other ID that is common for instruments that
                users program in a similar way.
            pins: The names of the pins or pin groups to translate to session_data,
                channel_group_ids, and channel_lists. The pins must be connected to instruments of
                type instrument_type_id.

        Returns:
            pin_query_context: An object that tracks the sessions and channels associated with this
                pin query. Use this object to publish measurements, extract data from a set of
                measurements, and create or rearrange waveforms.
            session_data: Returns a tuple of session data associated with pins.
            channel_group_ids: Returns the IDs of the channel groups that contain the channels
                connected to pins. For channels that do not belong to a channel group in the pin
                map, the Semiconductor Module creates a channel group with the same ID as the
                channel.
            channel_lists: Returns the channel lists that correspond to pins associated with
                session_data and channel_group_ids. Each channel list is a comma-separated list of
                channels. If any of the pins are connected to the same instrument channel for
                multiple sites, the channel appears only once in the list.
